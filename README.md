## The DRAW & GUESS game  by Amit Steiner
> Building a ‘Draw & Guess’ game for 2 players

### About the game
>* I built this game for "Moveo" (Recruitment assignment).


> This is my first project in HTML, CSS, and Node.js. Actually, this is the first time I've built something that requires both a backend and frontend, and also deployed it.  

> It was a major challenge to teach myself all of those technologies from scratch without any guidance, especially with such a tight deadline.

>I haven't finished the game yet, and I still have more to learn in order to complete it in the best way possible. Hopefully, I'll be able to do so in the next few days.

### About the technolgy
>* I chose to built the backend with Node JS, Express framework and EJS and a  .\
>* I chose to built the Frontend with JavaScript (and EJS as template engines), HTML5 and CSS .\
>* I chose Node because it is Non-blocking architecture (asynchronous by default).\
and it has more advantage like: ability to build API fast, handling request very fast, etc.\
>* I chose to work with MongoDB because its integrate easily with express, its scalabillity and flexibility.
