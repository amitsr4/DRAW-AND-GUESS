## The DRAW & GUESS game  by Amit Steiner
> Building a ‘Draw & Guess’ game for 2 players

### About the technolgy
>* I used Windows OS to built this project.
>* I chose to built the API with Node JS, Express framework and EJS and a  .\
>* I chose to built the Front with JavaScript (and EJS as template engines), HTML5 and CSS .\
>* I chose Node because it is Non-blocking architecture (asynchronous by default).\
and it has more advantage like: ability to build API fast, handling request very fast, etc.\
>* I chose to work with MongoDB because its integrate easily with express, its scalabillity and flexibility.

### Pre-requirements
>* Having **Node v16.15.0** (the version i used) or above on your machine.\

>* Having **npm v8.9.0** (the version i used) or above on your machine.\

>* run: 'npm install'

### Assumptions and other important notes
>* I'm case insensitive (i.e. "Be" and "be" are the same word)
>* Mid word dashes, commas and digits **and** every special chars (@,#,$,%,^,&,...) could be **cleaned up** (i.e. me2 could count as me)
>* i didnt have time to handle all edge cases i prefer to focus on the technolgy and make the things works.
>* I'm assuming that all input are valid.
>* If you have any problem with running this project please feel free to reach me at, Sahar.
